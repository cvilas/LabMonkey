Wishlist for the future

- Use the timing parameter in the WayPoint object to control motion time
- Stiffen up motor control gains
- Reimplement speed scaling as scaled time to waypoint 

- Waypoint editor UI
- Debounce buttons
- Feedback for button pushes - lamps (preferred), buzzer
- Simpler control interface on the arm (easy to get button pushes wrong at the moment)
- 3d display UI

- Implement joint limits
- Kinematic model 
- Dynamic model 
- gravity compensation
- Trajectory generation and control
- Force compliance (collision detection and force control)
- Improved motor design (reduce backlash)
- 3D camera integration
